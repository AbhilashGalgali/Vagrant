This is my Lab
To begin with, first we initiate the vagrant file using the vagrant init on the terminal (as Im using a mac) this generates the vagrant file where we have to make the relevant changes based upon the requirement of the vm environment. Once the changes have been made, the vagrant is ready to initialize and start the virtual machine and this is done using the vagrant up command. Now we can see that a VM is up based on the box we have selected and we can see in the GUI (usually a virtual box, based on the box) that a VM is been created and its up and running. Now to get into the VM that we have been created we ssh into the machine by vagrant ssh and then we get into it. Next part is to install an apache or apache2 so that we can get a server and thus can see the web page of the machine that we have created. We can also create and multi machines based on the requirements and all we have to do is make necessary changes in the configs in the vagrant file. Once we make changes we can reload it by vagrant reload and we can see the applied changes coming up in our machines.
